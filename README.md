Cloud Computing with FastAPI & Firebase

This project was originally built as part of a cloud computing course. It uses FastAPI as the backend framework and connects to Google Firebase using direct REST API calls and an authorization key instead of the Firestore Python client.

 Key Features

- FastAPI-based backend with endpoints for managing teams and drivers
- Firebase used as the backend database (manual API integration)
- Simple HTML/CSS frontend
- Authentication handled via API key
- Good UI layout and design


 What I Learned

- How to use FastAPI to build clean REST APIs
- Manual handling of authentication with Firebase
- Frontend integration with backend APIs
- The importance of providing setup files for reproducibility

 Excluded Files

For security reasons, the Firebase service account key JSON file is not included.
